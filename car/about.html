        <p>See what other customers are saying</p>
        <p>They were so freindly. At first I didn't buy, but after going to all the other dealers I realized they really were giving me the best deal</p>
        <br>
        <p>I wanted a different color, and I almost didn't ask because I needed the car yesterday. But when I explained they gave me a loaner car, and got the car I wanted 3 days later. I am so glad I came to them.</p>
